# Mimic

Mimic is a social network apliation I'm working on. I started on Nov. 12 2020.
I don't have that much experience coding or making apps cause I have never made an app before.
The only languages i know are html,css, and a bit of javascript. I realized today (2-13-21) that 
Most applications are name with java. Today I started learning java, it's not that easy so far but I'm
Starting to get the basics, but I am no where close to being able to make a mobile app.
